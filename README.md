# TAASSC
This repository is the landing page for code and resources for the Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Syntactic Sophistication and Complexity (version <= 2.0).

**This page is in progress**

## Overview of TAASSC Indices
TAASSC draws on at least three perspectives on the analysis of syntactic use. [need to finish this.]

## Notes on TAASSC Versions
The original version of TAASSC (Kyle, 2017; Kyle & Crossley, 2017, 2018) used Stanford CoreNLP (insert citation) and corpus data drawn from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA; Davies, 2009). Beginning with TAASSC 2.0, Spacy (insert citation) was used for part of speech tagging and dependency parsing, primarily because Spacy is written in Python and some end users had difficulty installing Java dependencies for Stanford CoreNLP. Because Mark Davies does not want frequency lists from COCA distributed publicly, TAASSC 1.x could not be truly open source. Accordingly, in TAASSC 2.0 corpus data was drawn from sections of the Corpus of the Web project (COW; insert citation).
